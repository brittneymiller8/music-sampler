<p>Walk the Moon is a group of four musicians from Cincinati, Ohio. Nicholas Petricca is the lead singer. Kevin Ray plays the bass. Sean Waugaman plays the drums. Eli Maiman plays the guitar. Their first self-titled major album was reeleased in 2012 and gave them some fame with songs like "Anna Sun," which you can listen to below. Their next album, Talking is Hard, catapulted them into the spotlight with their famous hit, "Shut Up and Dance." Their most recent album, What if Nothing, was released in late 2017.
